# AirBnBProject

The dataset can be found on Kaggle through this website: https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data. This project entails data wrangling, preprocessing and visualization. It aims to employ machine learning method to do housing price prediction.

### Data description
##### Context:
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC, NY for 2019.

##### Content:
This data file includes all needed information to find out more about hosts, geographical availability, necessary metrics to make predictions and draw conclusions.

### Project description
Outline of the project and step by step explanation

##### 1) Data wrangling and cleansing:
 |Import all necessary packages and libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
 
 |Load dataset in csv form
 
 |Get a general description of the dataset by using .shape(), .info(), .describe()
##### 2) Exploratory data analysis:
 |Learn variable types
 
 |Identify which columns have missing or null values
 
 |Replace null values with appropriate values depending on the nature of information
##### 3) Data visualization:
 |Plot all the neighborhood groups
 
 |Get correlation between different values
 
 |Plot all the neighborhood in each neighborhood groups
 
 |Plot all the room types
 
 |Correlation between neighborhood_group and availability
 
 |Map of neighborhood group
##### 4) Machine learning - Price prediction:
 |Use linear regression
 
 |Calculate mean absolute error and mean squared error
 
 |Display the actual prices and predicted prices after training the model (30%)
